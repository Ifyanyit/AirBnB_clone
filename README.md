# Introduction
This is an Alx project and the goal of the project is to deploy on our server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.
This project is done in series that lasts 4 months, after which we will have:

* A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
* A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic.
* A database or files that store data (data = objects).
* An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them).

## Supported classes

1. BaseModel
2. User
3. State
4. City
5. Amenity
6. Place
7. Review

## Commands

* create - create an object
* Show - show an object (base on id)
* destroy - destroy an object
* all - show all objects of one type or all types
* quit/EOF - quit the console
* help - see descriptions of commands
